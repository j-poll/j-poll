  <samp>I have a background in Health Care Management and hold a doctorate in Health Sciences. Currently, I work in the areas of Health Services Research, Project Management and Data Science. While my formal education provided me with experience in using SPSS and a SAS, I am also self-taught in Python and SQL. I am a strong supporter of massive open online courses, as they offer access to top-tier education from leading universities and companies worldwide. Additionally, I enjoy playing board and card games, so you might come across health and gaming-related projects on my profile in the future.
